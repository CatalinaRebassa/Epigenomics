##### 4. EN‐TEx ATAC‐seq data: downstream analyses #####

#### 1. Move to folder ATAC-seq, and create folders to store bigBed data files and peaks analyses files. 
####     Make sure the files are organized in a consistent way as done for ChIP-seq.

sudo docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --rm -it dgarrimar/epigenomics_course

git clone https://github.com/bborsari/epigenomics_uvic
cd epigenomics_uvic
cd ATAC-seq 
ls

#### 2. Retrieve from a newly generated metadata file ATAC-seq peaks (bigBed narrow, pseudoreplicated peaks, assembly GRCh38) for stomach and sigmoid_colon 
####    for the same donor used in the previous sections.

# We need to download specific files from the ENCODE (ENTEX), we selected the donor ENCDO451RUA; 
# Experiment with: 
    # Assay type: DNA binding
    # Status: released
    # Genome assembly: GRCh38
    # Biosample term name: stomach AND sigmoid colon
# We have selected a total of 28 experiments: 12 for stomach and 16 for sigmoid colon.
